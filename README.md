# üëã Hi,  

### I'm Bhavya Chawla, a Master's candidate in Computer Science at the Illinois Institute of Technology, specializing in Data analysis, machine learning, and Python programming. Passionate about leveraging data to solve complex problems, I'm on the lookout for roles where I can contribute to meaningful data analysis and machine learning projects.


## üîç What I Do:

- Data Analysis & Machine Learning: With a foundation in Python, SQL, and various machine learning frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras), I develop models that turn data into insights. My work on forecasting and classification tasks showcases my ability to apply theoretical knowledge in practical settings.
- Project Management Automation: Utilizing advanced technologies like GPT-3 and PostgreSQL, I've automated aspects of project management, focusing on cost estimation and planning. My projects demonstrate a blend of innovative AI application and solid data management skills.
- Software Development: Beyond data analysis, I'm experienced with CI/CD practices, React, JavaScript, and Docker, underscoring my versatility in tackling challenges across the software development lifecycle.


## üéØ Projects and Highlights:

- **Generative AI for Cost Estimation:** An innovative application of GPT-3 integrated with PostgreSQL to automate project management tasks, showcasing my proficiency in generative AI and data integration.  
- **Encoder Decoder LSTM on Household Electricity Consumption:** Utilizing advanced models such as Encoder-Decoder LSTM, CNN-LSTM, and Conv-LSTM, I improved electricity consumption forecasting over a dataset spanning four years, reducing RMSD by 35%, indicative of precise forecasting and potential cost savings.  
- **StackOverflow-GitHub Microservices:** Developed a system using Go, Docker, and PostgreSQL to collect and store data from Stack Overflow and GitHub, focusing on key frameworks. This project involved using Prometheus for monitoring and provided insights for data-driven decision-making, highlighting my skills in microservices architecture and API integration.  
- **Educational Contributions:** As a Graduate Teaching Assistant, I guide students through complex technologies like UML, CI/CD, and React, demonstrating my commitment to sharing knowledge and fostering learning.
